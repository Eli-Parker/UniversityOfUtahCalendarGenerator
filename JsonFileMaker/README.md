# JsonFileMaker


### Description

This class is a simple one which generates JSON files
for the UofUCalGen project.

### Notes 

Frustratingly, he UofUCalGen project is unable to read
from other websites due to blazor WASM projects being
unable to access other websites. This class is a simple
workaround to that problem.
