# CalendarController.cs


### Description

This class acts as an interface between the front-end and the three "back-end" classes that handle the creation of the calendar file.
It simplifies the process of creating a calendar file by allowing the front-end to add
events to the calendar file without having to worry about the specifics of how the file is created.

### Notes 

Some eagle-eyed readers may notice that the `CalendarController` class returns a dictionary containing all the event names
grouped by the table they came from, and say "Hey, that's the same type of data that the EventList class uses!".
You'd be correct, but I chose to reconstruct this because the `EventList` class uses the `Event` class in its' dictionary,
which is useful for creating events and for storage, but the front end only requires the event name to display to the user.
It was easier to reconstruct the Dictionary here, and return it to the view side.

## Usage

- Make a new instance of the CalendarController class:

```csharp
var ctlr = new CalendarController("https://registrar.utah.edu/academic-calendars/fall2024.php");
```

- Get list of events to display to the user:

```csharp
Dictionary<string, List<string>> events = ctlr.GetEvents();
```

- Get the .ics file to download:

```csharp
List<string> selectedEvents = ...;

byte[] calendarFile = ctlr.GetCalendarFileFromSelected( selectedEvents );

// Process file and send file to user
```


## Features

- Create an easy-access solution so that the view doesn't need to worry about the specifics of creating a calendar file.
- Return a dictionary of event names grouped by the table they came from.
- Add events to the calendar file and return it to the view.
