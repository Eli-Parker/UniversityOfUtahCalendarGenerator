# UofUCalGen


### Description

This is a Blazor WebAssembly project which serves as a front-end
for the user to interact with. The user selects a semester from a dropdown
and can select all the calendar dates from the semester to upload to their
Calendar.


### Dev Notes 

This is, without a doubt, my most clunky and unpolished project made for the calendar generator.
I am quite new to Blazor, web development, and HTML/CSS in general so I'm sure there's
many mistakes made and optimizations missed. I still felt like I should
give it a shot because it'd be a learning experience and I'm glad I did.
